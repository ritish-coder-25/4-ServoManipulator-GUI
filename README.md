# 4-Servo Manipulator
This project is on a Graphical User Interface created to run on a Raspberry Pi (preferably Model 4-B and above) to interface with a 4-Servo Manipulator.
This particular 4-Servo Manipulator is not completely planar. The base servo rotates on the vertical axis, while the other 3 servos move on the horizontal plane.
Make sure to install the required packages into the Raspberry Pi before running the GUI file.
For more details about the project, please do read the Project Documentation.
Thank you.
